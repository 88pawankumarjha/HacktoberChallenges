# Hacktoberfest2018 ~ Week 4 Challenge [Final]

For previous challenges, please look at [readmes](https://github.com/RaidAndFade/Hacktoberfest2018/tree/master/READMES).

*This is part of a series of weekly projects that will be in this repository over the span of hacktoberfest.*
*this is satire, it's meant to be cute and to see what potential PRs have (both during hacktoberfest and otherwise)*

## Hello World - Hardcore Mode

Raid is nearly finished perfecting his masterpiece, but he needs a sample of hello world in all the languages in the world!

## How can I help?!

Raid, although boasts about knowing so many languages, actually only knows a few, and he wanted to see how all the languages looked like.

## What do you mean by a sample of hello world?

It must be a unique version of hello world in your chosen language. The language you choose must be one that has not been done by another fellow contributor.
Here is an example of what you could do. Python is already taken.

```python
# By RaidAndFade - https://github.com/RaidAndFade

if __name__ == '__main__':
    name = input('Enter your name: ')
    if len(name) > 5:
        print('Hello {}, I hope you have a BAD time! (You suck)'.format(name))
    else:
        print("Hey {}, you're cool! Can you be my friend?".format(name))
```

## RULES 

1. Your submission must be in the `Hello World` directory `HelloWorld/hello_world.{language}`
2. Your submission must NOT be a duplicate of someone else's submission. It MUST be UNIQUE (the language MUST be UNIQUE, the sample MUST be UNIQUE).
3. Make sure to say who made it at the top of the file, using a comment.
4. The basics of hello world is that it expects some kind of input (eg. name) and outputs `Hello x!`. It MUST follow this principle.
5. No Malicious Code (cookie sniffing, iframe hacking, css local file stealing, ios rootkits, while loops that never end, CPU Monero Miners)
6. No NSFW (porn, nudes, pictures of your cat's testicles, severed heads)
7. No ADS (No advertising your product, No third party ads)
8. DO NOT MODIFY OTHER PEOPLE'S SUBMISSIONS. THESE PRS WILL BE INSTANTLY DENIED AND MARKED SPAM.

## But why is this a challenge?

The point of this challenge is to prove that you know how to code in coding languages, rather than simple HTML.
***THE LAST THING I WANT TO SEE FROM THIS CHALLENGE IS A BUNCH OF GENERIC HELLO WORLD FILES***

## Final note

Remember to check that your codes work by executing it in your language's compiler!
